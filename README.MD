# React Native Guide
This is a guide for beginners, if they want to dive in into the world of app development.

Read the documentation [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)


## Pre-requisites
- **JavaScript**
- **React.js** -> Components, JSX, States, Props etc.

## Overview
- React Native is a **Framework** for building **Native** apps using **JavaSctipt**.
- A **native** application is a software program that is developed for use on a **particular platform or device**.
- You donot need to know **IOS** or **Andriod** Development to develop native apps, unless you need to build very complex apps that directly use the native APIs of these platforms.
- All the code can be written in **JavaScript** and that code can be shared to make the IOS as well as the android application.
- IOS Development use **Objective C** or **Swing**.
- Android development use **Java** or **Kotlin**.
- Some common **examples** of apps that are built using **React Native** are:
  - **Facebook**
  - **Instagram**
  - **Pinterest**
  - **Skype**
  - **Uber Eats**
- There are **two** ways to build a **React Native** app:
  - **Expo CLI**
  - **React Native CLI**
- **Expo CLI** -> Expo is a set of **tools** and **framework** that sit on top of **React Native** and hides a lot of complexity from us. It makes incredibly **fast and easy** to build React Native Apps.
